Gqlimp is an executable npm package created for client applications that communicate with the graphql server. 
The reasons to create this tool are to accelerate development of server applications coded with graphql in the client part and to increase client - server interaction.

It is intended that the query scheme created on the graphql server can be used easily and accurately in the client application via Gqlimp.Thanks to perform programmatic processing when creating a query, it can be developped code more flexible and faster in client side.

When there is a change in the query scheme created on the server, the client will be aware of this change and will have to make the necessary arrangements thanks to the import mechanism.
